# Models Directory

This directory stores the AI models used by llama.cpp server.
Models are automatically downloaded on first startup.

The actual model files are excluded from git tracking via .gitignore
but this directory structure is preserved with this .gitkeep file.

Current model: devstral-q4_k_m.gguf (downloaded automatically)
