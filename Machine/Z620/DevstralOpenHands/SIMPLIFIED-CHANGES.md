# Simplified Setup - Changes Made

## Summary

Based on learnings from the test scripts, I've simplified the docker-compose setup to use only the essential variables needed for running the containers effectively.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified `.env` file
**Removed unnecessary variables:**
- `CUDA_VERSION`, `UBUNTU_VERSION` (not needed at runtime)
- `LLAMA_ARG_HOST` (hardcoded to 0.0.0.0)
- All OpenHands LLM environment variables (replaced with config files)
- OpenWebUI complex configuration variables
- Health check timing variables (using defaults)
- Sandbox volume variables (replaced with direct mounting)

**Kept essential variables:**
- CUDA architecture and GPU configuration
- llama.cpp server configuration (port, model path, performance settings)
- Container versions and ports
- Model download configuration

### 2. Simplified `docker-compose.yml`
**Removed:**
- Commented-out configuration options
- Complex LLM environment variables that don't work
- Unnecessary health check customizations
- Redundant volume configurations

**Kept:**
- Essential container configuration
- Required environment variables that actually work
- Proper volume mounting for data persistence
- Network configuration for inter-container communication

### 3. Simplified `start.sh` script
**Removed:**
- Complex permission checking and fixing logic
- Verbose health check monitoring with timeouts
- Unnecessary directory verification steps
- Redundant logging

**Added:**
- OpenHands configuration file creation (learned from test-openhands.sh)
- Simplified service waiting logic
- Direct curl-based health checks

**Kept:**
- Model download functionality
- Essential directory creation
- Docker runtime checks

## Key Learnings from Test Scripts

### From `test-llama-cpp.sh`:
- Direct docker run with fixed parameters works reliably
- Minimal environment variables are sufficient
- Simple health checks via curl are more reliable than complex Docker health monitoring

### From `test-openhands.sh`:
- OpenHands needs configuration files, not environment variables
- `settings.json` and `config.toml` provide proper LLM auto-configuration
- Simplified container parameters work better than complex ones

## Benefits of Simplification

1. **Reliability**: Fewer variables = fewer points of failure
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and debug
3. **Performance**: Faster startup with less overhead
4. **Compatibility**: Based on working test script configurations

## Files Changed

- `.env` - Reduced from 89 lines to 27 lines of essential configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Simplified container definitions, removed unused options  
- `start.sh` - Streamlined startup process, added config file creation
- `start-old.sh` - Backup of original complex version

## Usage

The simplified setup maintains all functionality while being much easier to use:

```bash
./start.sh  # Start all services with auto-configuration
docker compose down  # Stop all services
```

OpenHands will now start with LLM pre-configured automatically, eliminating the manual setup step that was previously required.
